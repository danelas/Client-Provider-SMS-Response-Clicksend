## üöÄ Ready for Production

The system is now configured as a **lead generation platform** where:

1. **Customers submit inquiries** via FluentForm
2. **Providers receive lead notifications** via SMS
3. **Providers confirm interest** by replying "Y"
4. **Providers get customer contact details** immediately
5. **Providers contact customers directly** to arrange service

This creates a more personal, direct connection between providers and customers while maintaining all the automation and tracking benefits of the existing system.

## üìä Form Integration

Your FluentForm should continue pointing to:
```
https://client-provider-sms-response-clicksend-1.onrender.com/api/booking
```

The endpoint handles the data exactly the same way, but now operates as a lead generation system rather than a booking confirmation system.
